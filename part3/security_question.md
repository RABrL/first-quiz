## Injection: 
Check for SQL Injection and NoSQL Injection vulnerabilities in your Python backend code when interacting with the MySQL database. Ensure you're using parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent these types of attacks.

## Broken Authentication:
Review the authentication mechanisms in your mobile app, web frontend, and backend. Ensure strong password hashing, session management, and implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

## Sensitive Data Exposure:
Confirm that customer data in your MySQL database is stored securely by using encryption (at rest and in transit), and access control lists. Also, restrict access to sensitive customer information to only authorized personnel, such as customer support employees.

## XML External Entities (XXE):
Ensure that your app does not process XML input from untrusted sources. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent XXE attacks in your app.

## Broken Access Control:
Review your access control mechanisms to ensure that employees have the least privilege necessary to perform their job functions. Define and enforce roles and permissions for each user type.

## Security Misconfiguration:
Review your Kubernetes container configurations to ensure they are properly hardened. Scan for exposed APIs and sensitive information, and implement regular security reviews of your infrastructure.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Ensure that data passed to and from your web frontend is sanitized and that JavaScript libraries are up-to-date. Educate your development team on best practices for preventing XSS attacks.

## Insecure Deserialization:
 Check your application for vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization, particularly in the Python backend. Use safe serialization formats and validate incoming data to prevent attacks.

## Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:
Regularly monitor and update all third-party libraries and dependencies used in your application. Keep an eye on security advisories and patches for these components.

## Insufficient Logging & Monitoring:
Implement logging and monitoring for your application. Set up alerts for suspicious activities, such as multiple login failures or unauthorized access attempts. Ensure logs are protected and regularly reviewed.
